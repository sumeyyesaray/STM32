# STM32 Projects

This repository contains a collection of small-scale projects I developed during my embedded systems internship, using the **STM32** microcontroller family. Most of the projects were implemented using **STM32CubeIDE** along with **HAL libraries**.

The projects include:

- Basic GPIO applications  
- UART communication  
- PWM signal generation  
- ADC usage  
- Various sensor integrations  

Each project is organized in its own folder with relevant source files and comments for clarity.

## 📝 Notes

These projects were developed for **learning** and **experimentation** purposes.  
Some implementations may be simplified, incomplete, or open to improvement.

**Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome!**
