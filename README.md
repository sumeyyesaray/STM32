STM32 Projects
This repository contains a collection of small-scale projects I developed during my embedded systems internship, using the STM32 microcontroller family. Most of the projects were implemented using STM32CubeIDE along with HAL libraries.

The projects include basic GPIO applications, UART communication, PWM signal generation, ADC usage, and various sensor integrations. Each project is organized in its own folder with relevant source files and comments for clarity.

Purpose
To gain hands-on experience with STM32 architecture

To apply fundamental embedded systems concepts in practice

To document my progress and create a personal reference

Requirements
STM32CubeIDE

An STM32 Nucleo or Discovery development board

(Optional) Sensors or other hardware modules

Notes
These projects were developed for learning and experimentation purposes. Some implementations may be simplified, incomplete, or open to improvement. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome.
