# 🛠 STM32

## What is STM32?
STM32 is a family of **microcontrollers** produced by STMicroelectronics, based on **ARM architecture**. It is commonly used in embedded systems.  
ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) → A low-power, high-efficiency processor architecture based on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer).  
It is widely used in microcontrollers like STM32 as well as in phones, tablets, and similar devices.
-Includes cortes processor.

## 🧠 What is a Microcontroller?

- A single chip that includes **CPU**, **RAM**, **Flash/ROM**, and **I/O units**.
- Can directly interact with hardware and peripheral devices.
- Typically performs fixed tasks (e.g., washing machines, robot vacuums).
- Operates with **low clock speed** and **limited RAM**.

## 💻 What is a Microprocessor?

- An integrated circuit that contains only the **CPU**.
- Memory and I/O units are connected externally.
- Designed for general-purpose computing (e.g., desktop computers).
- Features **high clock speed** and **large RAM capacity**.
